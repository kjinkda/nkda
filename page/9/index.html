You can call it a disease. <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/obesity#tab=tab_1" title="Who Obesity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WHO</a> or World Health Organization sometimes referred it as a epidemic. </p><p>Obesity is generally results when you are taking more calories but burning less.

The excessive body fat increases the risk of serious health problems.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img src="https://nkda.pages.dev/media/posts/1/hand-drawn-bmi-infographic-bmi-islam-alp-bathmos-com.avif" alt="checking obesity from bmi" width="626" height="481"></figure><p><strong>How to calculate BMI?</strong> Here is a simple solution. Find your weight in lbs. Next, find your height in inches. First multiply your weight in pounds by 703. Now divide the result by height in inches( there are 12 inches in a foot) . Again divide the result by height.</p><p>Lets us assume that, your weight is 200 pounds and your height is 5 foot 8 inch.  So your height in inches will be 68.</p><p>Step 1: First multiple your weight in pound by 703. ie 200x703 = 140600.</p><p>Step 2: Divide the result by height (in inches). ie 140600/ 68 =2067.64</p><p>Step 3: Divide again the obtained result by height. ie 2067.64/68 =30.40</p><p>So your BMI is 30.40.</p><p><strong>How to know whether you are obese or not from BMI?</strong></p><p>Here I am providing you a simple table from which you can easily identify whether you are obese or not after finding your BMI. </p><table class="align-center" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 303.156px; border-color: #236fa1; border-style: solid;" border="2"><tbody><tr><td><strong>BMI Value</strong></td><td><strong>Indication</strong></td></tr><tr><td>&lt;18.5</td><td>Underweight</td></tr><tr style="height: 50px;"><td>18.5–24.9</td><td>Normal Weight</td></tr><tr><td>25–29.9</td><td>Overweight</td></tr><tr><td>BMI of 30 or greater </td><td>Obesity</td></tr></tbody></table><h1 id="Why-should-you-get-rid-of-obesity">🌟 <strong>Why should you get rid of obesity? </strong>🌟</h1><p>Let me share a story. After reading the story you will know exactly how obesity is affecting your social and family life.  Back in 2004 I was  teaching as professor(lecturer) in an engineering college. When the last bell used to rang every faculty member and students used came out of the class.  Faculty member used to reserve a seat in faculty bus using handkerchief or bag anything. The facility was provided by the college for professor living in city or distant places. <br><br>One day myself and few of my fellow colleagues could not reserve a set, so we have no chance but to avail the rear seats in the bus and tolerate all the jerking throughout our journey.  Another lady ( Our Colleague) came shouting that she could not find any seat and finally took the last one with us. She was fat. When she took the seat, she almost pissed us. Actually she requires space for two person. She was very popular among us. </p><p><br>One colleague commented " Woh !, See how smooth the bus is plying". So the lady faculty asked " What do you think about the reason". Then my senior colleague said " See, the bus is in perfectly balanced condition, because in front of the bus there is engine and in back, then he pointed the lady faculty. </p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img src="https://nkda.pages.dev/media/posts/1/us-obesity-statistics.avif" alt="US Obesity Statistics" width="1366" height="768"></figure><br>There was a huge laughter amongst all of us. The lady faculty became so angry that she probably hit few of us randomly.  <br><br>I shared the story because it happens everyday with us. If you are obese your colleague or neighbour will laugh at you. Your husband will try to find slim office girl. Your friend and others will try to give a new nickname etc. <p></p><p>But  the list does not end here. There are several incidents in US where obese employees were fired from their job. For example Karen( not real name) lost her receptionist job because of obesity. </p><p>Sometimes obese people are fired from job simply providing other reason. One women (US) reported that her boss joked that health insurance package is available for only healthy ones.</p><p>The stories does not end here. You will find numerous divorces because of this. Either husband wants divorce from obese wife or wife wants divorce from fat husband. </p><p>These are all social problems but what about medical problems. If you are obese the diabetes will knock at your door. Obesity will also invite heart disease. It will bring some kind of distraction in your eyesight. It will also try to damage liver and so on. </p><p><span style="color: #2dc26b;"><strong>Obesity Problems</strong></span></p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-greek; color: #1cce15;"><li>Obesity affects you social life, people will call "fat", "overweight".</li><li>It affects your married life</li><li>It can also affect your professional life affecting jobs , promotions</li></ol><p>It can bring a bunch of other disease such as diabetes, cardio vascular disease, eye sight and even cancer. </p><p>Lets see this list what problems can obesity bring to you and affects your healthy life. </p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li><strong>Cardiovascular disease:  </strong>Obesity is a major risk factor for  cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and stroke . These are leading causes of death worldwide.</li><li><strong>Type 2 diabetes</strong>: If you are overweight, it is very likely you will be having diabetes and its associated conditions, even sometimes need for dialysis. Rates of diabetes have increased 4 times around the world since 1980.</li><li><strong>High blood pressure:  </strong>Medically t<span class="ILfuVd" lang="en"><span class="hgKElc">here is a clear and  established link between obesity and hypertension. The bank of excess adipose tissue initiates a cascade of events that give rise to an increased  blood pressure. </span></span></li><li><strong>Osteoarthritis: </strong>Obesity can lead to musculoskeletal disorders and arthrosis <strong>  </strong> </li><li><strong>Miscellaneous diseases</strong>: Obesity is also associated with some form of cancers. It  includes  breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, gallbladder, kidney and colon cancer. Sleep disorder or Sleep apnoea is also very common. Forget  not that depression and other mental health conditions is also associated with obesity. <br>    </li></ol><h1 id="Root-causes-of-weight-gain">⚖️ Root causes of weight gain ⚖️</h1><p><strong> </strong><strong>What are the main causes of weight gain? </strong>The main causes of weight gain is your body. The other causes are your eating behaviour, life style, Insulin resistance, levels of testosterone and estrogen, hormonal imbalance etc.</p><p>Once when I was obese I decided to meet a doctor. He had degree from London and was charging 5 times than other doctors. So after taking appointment I met him. He asked so many question on eating habit, food I eat, where I work etc.</p><p>After that I asked "Why I am obese?". He said its because of your body. Your body is so efficient in converting carbs into fat. It stores fat for future. You are supposed to born during the time of famine. But you have born during the time abundance.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img src="https://nkda.pages.dev/media/posts/1/Obesity.avif" alt="Obesity Round Belly" width="640" height="426"></figure><p>The he suggested me some life style changes. First he told me that I need to control satiety. He said you need to take a lot of vegetables or low calorie food. </p><p>Then he said that you you should eat on small plates such that it looks like lot to you. He asked to continue physical activity ( like running, jogging, swimming etc.). Finally he prescribed some blood test for thyroid.</p><p>During discussion he told me that I am or anyone fat because the person consumes more calories but burns less. So we need focus more on our eating behaviour. Dr told that taking piece of bread with butter is such calorie consumption that if you run 8KM then only you can burn that much of calorie.</p><p>He discussed some points related to me. But there are various factors which leads to obesity. Some of these are thyroid, PCOS, insulin resistance etc.  <br>Some of these factors may cause increased appetite, unhealthy food cravings, slowed metabolism, and energy imbalances. All of which may lead to weight gain over time.  </p><p>Regular exercise and avoiding environmental toxins can help maintain hormonal balance and support weight management.<span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> Regular exercise and avoiding environmental toxins can help maintain hormonal balance and support weight management.</span></p><p><span style="color: #2dc26b;"><strong>Root causes of obesity</strong></span></p><ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li><span style="color: #fa870a;">You used to take more calories in the form of food and drinks</span></li><li><span style="color: #fa870a;">Your body burns less fat than it supposed to burn</span></li><li><span style="color: #fa870a;">Your body has some kind of hormonal imbalance</span></li></ul><p>But following the strict life eating behaviour is not easy but I think you need to take some supplement which will automatically reduce your craving for food. That's where supplement come into factor. </p><p>There are lots of research in recent times on obesity. One of the factor found low body temperature. That is one kind of hindrance for melting your body fat.  Today I shall introduce some super food and herbs based  supplement which will work like charm.</p><p>You need not to have do restricted routine and create a lean menu but the supplement itself will do the work.

According to the product's official resources, each element of the recipe was selected after careful consideration of relevant research.<br><br>These are perfectly blended to optimize body temperature and keep your metabolism working at its best.<br><br><strong>Step 1: Helps combat low body temperature.</strong><br><br>Low body temperature not only impedes the calorie-burning process but can also affect many other bodily functions. Alpilean targets exactly these aspects of the body.<br><br>The natural ingredients used in the product help raise core body temperature.  Alpilean increases low body temperature and optimizes metabolism.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><br><br><strong>Step 2: Maintain a Normal Body Temperature for Weight Loss</strong><br><br>Each body is different. Some people can lose optimal weight when their temperature is X, while others can optimally lose weight when their temperature is Y.<br><br>There is no right or wrong. It depends on your weight make-up, body shape, type, etc. Alpilean makes all this easy. As the brand claims, these organic diet pills normalize body temperature, leaving "you" in the perfect conditions to shed excess pounds. <br><br><img src="https://nkda.pages.dev/media/posts/1/alpilean-weight-loss-steps.avif" alt="Alpilean Weight Loss Step by Step" width="675" height="450"></figure><br><br><strong>Step 3: Promote Weight Loss by Raising Core Body Temperature</strong><br><br>Weight loss is one of the most misunderstood processes. Some people may not be able to effectively lose weight by doing these obvious things.<br><br>An important underlying aspect is ignored. And one such factor is body temperature. Alpilean comes into play in exactly this scenario. Utilizes core body temperature processes to optimize efficient metabolism and promote weight loss.<br><br>The optimal body temperature is 37 degrees Celsius. This temperature must be maintained for the body to work effectively. For every 1°C drop in body temperature, your metabolism slows by more than 13%. <p></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><a href="https://cutt.ly/ewpfjeHO" title="Check Video to Loss Weight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://nkda.pages.dev/media/posts/1/two-girls-with-different-body-shapes-diets.avif" alt="Body Transformation" width="626" height="505"></a></figure><br>Digestive enzymes require an optimum temperature of 37 degrees Celsius to break down ingested food into usable nutrients. If your body temperature is less than this then this results in decreased food breakdown, inadequate absorption of nutrients, and consequent loss of body weight may increase.
